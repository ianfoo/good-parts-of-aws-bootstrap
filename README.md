# good-parts-of-aws-bootstrap

This is the example application for
[The Good Parts of AWS](https://gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts),
as described in *Part  2: The Bootstrap Guide*. The interesting
parts of this application are everything except the application
itself, which is just a hello-world HTTP server.
